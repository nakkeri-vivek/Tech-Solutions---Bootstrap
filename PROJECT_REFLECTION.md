## 🛠️ Tools and Resources Used

### Primary Resources:
1. **Bootstrap 5 Official Documentation**: 
   - Used for component reference and API documentation
   - Referenced for proper usage of components
   - Checked for latest features and utilities

2. **Bootstrap Examples**:
   - Explored various example pages for inspiration
   - Studied component combinations
   - Learned best practices for layout composition

3. **Bootstrap Icons**:
   - Used for iconography throughout the site
   - Integrated via CDN for easy access

### Development Tools:
- **VS Code**: Code editor
- **Browser DevTools**: For testing and debugging
- **Git**: For version control

### AI Assistance:
- **ChatGPT/Claude**: Used for:
  - Clarifying Bootstrap component usage
  - Getting suggestions for component combinations
  - Debugging CSS issues
  - Code structure recommendations

**Note**: While AI tools were consulted for guidance, all code was written and customized by hand. Components were remixed and combined creatively rather than copy-pasted directly.

## 🎨 Component Remixing Approach

### Not Just Copy-Paste:
- **Navbar**: Combined Bootstrap navbar with custom branding and active states
- **Carousel**: Customized with gradient backgrounds and custom content
- **Cards**: Remixed card components with custom hover effects and icon integration
- **Forms**: Enhanced Bootstrap forms with custom validation and styling
- **Modals**: Created custom modal content for consultation and success messages
- **Grid System**: Used creatively for different layouts on each page

### Creative Additions:
- Custom gradient hero sections
- Smooth hover animations
- Custom color scheme
- Responsive typography adjustments
- Custom spacing and shadows

## 🚧 Challenges Faced and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Responsive Carousel Height
**Problem**: Carousel height was too large on mobile devices
**Solution**: Used media queries to adjust min-height for different screen sizes and changed background-attachment to scroll on mobile

### Challenge 2: Form Validation
**Problem**: Needed proper form validation without external libraries
**Solution**: Used Bootstrap's built-in validation classes and JavaScript to handle form submission and show success modal

### Challenge 3: Consistent Spacing
**Problem**: Maintaining consistent spacing across all pages
**Solution**: Used Bootstrap's spacing utilities consistently and created custom CSS variables for common values

### Challenge 4: Mobile Navigation
**Problem**: Fixed navbar covering content on mobile
**Solution**: Added padding-top to body element to account for fixed navbar height

### Challenge 5: Card Hover Effects
**Problem**: Making cards interactive without being distracting
**Solution**: Created subtle hover effects using CSS transforms and transitions
